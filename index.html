        <h2>About the GSA</h2>
        <p>The Graduate Student Association (GSA) is both the governing body and planning board primarily for graduate students enrolled in face-to-face quarter programs, in addition to the recognized graduate student organizations registered with Campus Engagement within Student Life. The GSA also advocates for and serves all graduate students across the University, including online and semester programs, collaborating with the Graduate College and campus partners to enhance the graduate student experience.</p>
        <p>The Executive Board Members of the GSA are nominated and elected by graduate students annually in the spring and serve from July 1 - June 30 (fiscal year). In collaboration with the Graduate College, Campus Engagement within Student Life, and various academic and student services units, the GSA and recognized graduate student organizations host hundreds of programs and events to meet the many interests of the graduate student population at Drexel and bring together students, postdocs, alumni, faculty, and professional staff across academic disciplines and organizations. From research symposiums, academic panels, interdisciplinary workshops, and writing boot camps, to ski trips, white water rafting, intramural sports, and happy hours, there is something for everyone in our vibrant Drexel graduate student community.</p>
